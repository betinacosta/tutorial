# CSS â€“ make it pretty!

Our blog still looks pretty ugly, right? Time to make it nice! We will use CSS for that.

## What is CSS?

```Cascading Style Sheets``` (CSS) is a language used for describing the look and formatting of a website written in a markup language (like HTML). Treat it as make-up for our web page. ;)

But we don't want to start from scratch again, right? Once more, we'll use something that programmers released on the Internet for free. Reinventing the wheel is no fun, you know.
