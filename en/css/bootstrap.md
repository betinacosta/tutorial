# Let's use Bootstrap!

Bootstrap is one of the most popular HTML and CSS frameworks for developing beautiful websites:

It was written by programmers who worked for Twitter. Now it's developed by volunteers from all over the world!

## Install Bootstrap

To install Bootstrap, you need to add this to your `<head>` in your `.html` file:

{% filename %}blog/templates/blog/post_list.html{% endfilename %}
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.2.0/css/bootstrap.min.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.2.0/css/bootstrap-theme.min.css">
```

This doesn't add any files to your project. It just points to files that exist on the Internet. Just go ahead, open your website and refresh the page. Here it is!
